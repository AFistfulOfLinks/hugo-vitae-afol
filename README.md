# Vitae
... is a blog theme for Hugo that **focuses on your content** with some cool new **features**.

## Welcome the the REDESIGN.

The foundation of the theme is now completely rewritten from scratch. This
version is now ready for first tests and error analysis.

Until the redesign can replace the current version, it will take some time.

If you notice anything, please write an issue.

**!This version should currently not been used for live-blogs!**

```sh
cd themes
